# [fit] Everyone thinks they want self-service Infrastructure

- PaaS is an answer to a problem

# Legal

- We want to open source the software we write

[Introduction to Value Chain Mapping at OSCon] (https://youtu.be/NnFeIt-uaEc)

> The _actual_ company values, as opposed to the _nice-sounding_ values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go

# [fit] We Don't Trust our People To do the right thing.

- We used to think of people of task masters who should not make decisions, but the world has changed.

- IT is a knowledge business.  People who write algorithm for hyper-efficient search, can probably make reasonable business decisions.

- Individuals are afraid to make decisions because changing direction is a major commitment in time and effort.

> If you think most of your organization is stupid and lazy, then you are most likely stupid and most definitely lazy.

- Authorship, Responsibility and Transparency (Etsy)
- Openness and Collaboration

# Systems Thinking

We need to focus on outcomes rather than activities.

# Organizational Learning

> The only sustainable competitive advantage is an organization's ability to learn faster than the competition.

---

# Collaboration

> Collaboration is vital to sustain what we call profound or really deep change, because without it, organizations are just overwhelmed by the forces of the status quo.

-- Peter Senge
