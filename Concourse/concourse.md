# [fit] Untangling Platform Complexity 
# with Concourse CI

---

# Summary

- Product mindset drives an automation heavy culture
- We iterated our way to success
- We have created engineering capacity through automation
- You can do it too!

---

# [fit] Culture

---

# Platform as a Product

  - Customer
      - Developers that need to deploy operable software quickly and reliably without friction. 
  - Problem
      - Developers spend too much time on process heavy lifing and non-business value added work.
      - Developers expect access to the latest and greatest technolgy for use with their products.
  - Solution
      - An integrated platform with connected services that make the right thing the easy thing.
      - Minimize the operational burdon of operating the overall platform.

---

# The Starting Point

  - ELK
  - 6 Cloud Foundry Foundations in 3 environments (Need a pic)
  - No Production
  - No Automation
  - Several tiles (Mobile push, mySQL, Redis)

---

# Too Much Time Maintaining CF

- Basically 100% of engineering time
  - Tiles broke frequently (Upgrade order matters)
    - e.g. RabbitMQ must be upgraded before mobile push
  - Lack of consistency

---

(Operational Tax Rate was high)

---

# Our Goal

  - Reduce the operational burden of running and scaling the platform.
  - No more #@$*^$ GUI's.
  - Be able to reliably and quickly build new environments
  - Ensure that our CF environments look consistent

---

# Solution Requirements

  - Environments can be represented and versioned through source control
  - Automated testing for all platform components
  - Support the complex workflow of deploying CF
  - Manage all the things

- Inputs:
    * Component -> Tile 
    * Image -> Stemcell
    * Configuration -> YAML
- JOB
- Outputs

---

# Definitions

  - Task
  - Resource
  - Pipeline

---

# [fit] The Journey

---

# Attempt Number One

Single pipeline to rule them all (pic)

- Let concourse manage platform components (concourse resource)
  * Tiles
  * Ops Manager 
  * Stemcells
- Let concourse and git manage configurations (concourse resource)
- Bash to deploy ops manager appliance (concourse tasks)
- Bash to deploy using experimental ops manager api (concourse tasks)
- Needed to vendor packages into internal artifact repository

---

# Benefits

- Codified tile dependencies
- Each environment was perfectly consistent
- New environment provisioning went from 1 week to 8 hours
- Engineering time for a deployment went from 40 hours to 3 hours

---

# Problems

- Concourse pipeline definition file was large and repetitive (2-3K Lines)
- Managing multiple concurrent versions of Ops Manager was difficult with Bash
- Concourse missing proxy support 

---

# Attempt Number Two

- Generate single pipelines per product
    - Ops Manager
    - Tiles: Elastic Runtime, MySQL, Redis
- Build ruby gem to replace Bash Tasks
  - Integration Tests for Ops Manager API breaking changes
- Manage, release and deploy our own fork of concourse
    - Added proxy support

---

# Benefits

- We were able to build only the components that changed
- Pipeline definitions were smaller and more and responsible for a single component
- Fail faster when there were breaking Ops Manager API changes
- Easier management of multiple versions of Ops Manager API
- Can pull resources directly from Pivotal Network

---

# Problems

- Concourse pipeline definitions were repetitive
- We had forked Concourse, so we had to merge changes

---

# Attempt Three

- Wrote a generation tool for Concourse Pipelines (Travel Agent)
- Moved to latest open source version of Concourse
- Fully integrated Pivotal Network resource

---

# Benefits

- Reuced pipeline definitions from 400 line yaml to a template + 40 line config
- Reduced human error by not repeating ourselves in pipeline definitions
- Built in validation of generated pipelines
- We no longer have to maintain a fork of Concourse
- We no longer maintain Bash scripts to pull from Pivotal Network
- Engineering time for a deployment went from 3 hours to 2 hours

---

# From / To Slide

---

# What we Manage

- 6 Engineers
- 10 Foundations
- X Pipelines
- 2 Datacenters
- X servers
- Features we have deployed because we have not been patching

---

# Lessons Learned

- Iteration and learning is key and part of the journey
- Start with triggers turned off
- Don't be afraid to code 
- Focus on removing error from the system
- Smaller pipelines with a single responsibility reduce complexity
  - Faster feedback
  - easier to reason about

---

# How to get started

- [Awesome Stark and Wayne Tutorial] (https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial)
- Start with Ops Manager
- Evolve to BOSH Director
- Evolve to Cloud Foundry
- Evolve to the platform
