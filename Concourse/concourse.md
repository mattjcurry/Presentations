# Summary

- Product mindset drives an automation heavy culture
- We iterated our way to success
- We have created engineering capacity through automation
- You can do it too!

---

# [fit] Culture

---

# Platform as a Product

  - Customer
      - Developers that need to deploy operable software quickly and reliably without friction. 
  - Problem
      - Developers spend too much time on process heavy lifing and non-business value added work.
      - Developers expect access to the latest and greatest technolgy for use with their products.
  - Solution
      - An integrated platform with connected services that make the right thing the easy thing.
      - Minimize the operational burdon of running an app on the platform.

---

# The Starting Point

  - ELK
  - 6 Cloud Foundry Foundations in 3 environments (Need a pic)
  - No Production
  - No Automation
  - Several tiles (Mobile push, mySQL, Redis)

---

# Too Much Time Maintaining CF

- Basically 100% of engineering time
  - Tiles broke frequently (Upgrade order matters)
    - e.g. RabbitMQ must be upgraded before mobile push
  - Lack of consistency

---

- Operational Tax Rate was too high, suppressing our ability to innovate.

---

# Our Initial Goal

  - Reduce the operational burden of running and scaling the platform.
  - No more #@$*^$ GUI's.
  - Be able to reliably and quickly build new environments
  - Ensure that our CF environments look consistent
  - Have a consitent and reliable way to recover in case of lost failure

---

# Solution Requirements

  - Environments can be represented and versioned through source control
  - Automated testing for all platform components
  - Support the complex workflow of deploying CF and its ecosystem


---

> Releasing software should be easy. It should be easy because you have tested every single part of the release process hundreds of times before. It should be as simple as pressing a button. The repeatability and reliability derive from two principles: automate almost everything, and keep everything you need to build, deploy, test, and release your application in version control.

- Inputs:
    * Component -> Tile 
    * Image -> Stemcell
    * Configuration -> YAML
- JOB
- Outputs

---

# Definitions

  - Task
  - Resource
  - Pipeline

---

# [fit] The Journey

---

# Attempt Number One

Single pipeline to rule them all (pic)

- Let concourse manage platform components (concourse resource)
  * Tiles
  * Ops Manager 
  * Stemcells
- Let concourse and git manage configurations (concourse resource)
- Bash to deploy ops manager appliance (concourse tasks)
- Bash to deploy using experimental ops manager api (concourse tasks)
- Needed to vendor packages into internal artifact repository

---

# Benefits

- Codified tile dependencies
- Each environment was perfectly consistent
- New environment provisioning went from 1 week to 8 hours
- Engineering time for a deployment went from 40 hours to 3 hours

---

# Problems

- Concourse pipeline definition file was large, complex and repetitive (2-3K Lines)
- Managing multiple concurrent versions of Ops Manager was difficult with Bash
- No official API for Ops Manager
- Concourse missing proxy support 

---

![fit](../common/images/kata.png)

---

# Attempt Number Two

- Generate single pipelines per product
    - Ops Manager
    - Tiles: Elastic Runtime, MySQL, Redis
- Build ruby gem to replace Bash Tasks
  - Integration Tests for Ops Manager API breaking changes
- Manage, release and deploy our own fork of concourse
    - Added proxy support

---

> If we reduce batch sizes by half, we also reduce by half the time it will take to process a batch. That means we reduce queue and wait by half as well. Reduce those by half, and we reduce by about half the total time parts spend in the plant. Reduce the time parts spend in the plant and our total lead time condenses. And with faster turn-around on orders, customers get their orders faster.
-- Eliyahu M. Goldratt, The Goal


---

# Benefits

- We were able to build only the components that changed
- Pipeline definitions were smaller and more and responsible for a single component
- Fail faster when there were breaking Ops Manager API changes
- Easier management of multiple versions of Ops Manager API
- Can pull resources directly from Pivotal Network

---

# Problems

- Concourse pipeline definitions were repetitive
- Spending log of time writing boilerplate config/code to create pipelines
- We had forked Concourse, so we had to merge changes

---

# Attempt Three

- Wrote a generation tool for Concourse Pipelines (Travel Agent)
- Moved to latest open source version of Concourse
- Fully integrated Pivotal Network resource

---

# Benefits

- Reuced pipeline definitions from 400 line yaml to a template + 40 line config
- Reduced human error by not repeating ourselves in pipeline definitions
- Built in validation of generated pipelines
- We no longer have to maintain a fork of Concourse
- We no longer maintain Bash scripts to pull from Pivotal Network
- Engineering time for a deployment went from 3 hours to 2 hours

---

# From / To Slide

---

# What we Manage

- 6 Engineers
- 10 Foundations
- X Pipelines
- 2 Datacenters
- X servers
- Features we have deployed because we have not been patching

---

# Lessons Learned

- Iteration and learning is key and part of the journey
- Start with triggers turned off
- Don't be afraid to code 
- Focus on removing error from the system
- Smaller pipelines with a single responsibility reduce complexity
  - Faster feedback
  - easier to reason about

---

# Dont be afraid of change, embrace it and get good at it 

---

# How to get started

- [Awesome Stark and Wayne Tutorial] (https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial)
- Start with Ops Manager
- Evolve to BOSH Director
- Evolve to Cloud Foundry
- Evolve to the platform

# Announcing Deployadactly
### An open source for deploying to multiple CF foundations

Deployadactyl is a Go library for deploying applications to multiple Cloud Foundry instances. Deployadactyl utilizes blue green deployments and if it's unable to push your application it will rollback to the previous version. Deployadactyl utilizes Gochannels for concurrent deployments across the multiple Cloud Foundry instances.
