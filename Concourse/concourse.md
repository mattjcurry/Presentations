# Summary

- Product mindset drives an automation heavy culture
- We iterated our way to success
- We have created engineering capacity through automation
- You can do it too!

---

# [fit] Culture

---

# Platform as a Product

  - Customer
      - Developers 
  - Problem
      - Too much time on non-business value added work
  - Solution
      - Connected Platform
      - Minimize the operational burden of running apps

---

![fit] (../common/images/whackamole.jpg)

# The Starting Point

  - 3 full time engineers
  - 3 Cloud Foundry Foundations
  - Several tiles (Mobile push, mySQL, Redis)
  - No production environment
  - Manual upgrades of the platform

---

![fit] (../common/images/agile_manifesto.png)

---

# Our Initial Goals

  - Reduce the operational burden of running and scaling the platform.
    - Ensure that our CF environments look consistent
    - Automate testing of platform products
  - Have a reliable way to recover in case of failure
    - Ensure environments can be reproduced from source control
  - Automate Everything
    - No more #@$*^$ GUI's.

> Releasing software should be easy. It should be easy because you have tested every single part of the release process hundreds of times before. It should be as simple as pressing a button. The repeatability and reliability derive from two principles: automate almost everything, and keep everything you need to build, deploy, test, and release your application in version control.

# [fit] The Journey

---

## First Iteration

- Concourse tasks instead of resources to manage:
  * Tiles
  * Ops Manager
  * Stemcells
- Vendor products dependencies into internal artifact repository
- Let Concourse git resource manage configurations
- Deploy ops manager appliance with Concourse Bash task
- Deploy PCF tiles though Concourse Bash tasks using experimental ops manager API

---

# Benefits

- Codified tile dependencies
- Each environment was perfectly consistent
- New environment provisioning went from 1 week to 18 hours
- Engineering time for a deployment went from 40 hours to 4 hours

---

# Opportunities

- Concourse pipeline definition file was large, complex and repetitive (2-3K Lines)
- Managing multiple concurrent versions of Ops Manager was difficult with Bash
- No official API for Ops Manager
- Vendoring dependencies

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ![fit](../common/images/kata.png) -->

---

# Second Iteration

- Generate single pipelines per product
    - Ops Manager
    - Tiles: Elastic Runtime, MySQL, Redis
- Manage, release and deploy our own fork of Concourse
    - Added proxy support
- Build command line application for Ops Manager
  - Integration Tests for Ops Manager API breaking changes

---

![inline fill](../common/images/second_iteration.png)

---

# Benefits

- Pipeline definitions were granular and responsible for a single product
- Easier management of multiple versions of Ops Manager API
- Can pull dependencies directly from Pivotal Network through Concourse tasks

---

# Opportunities

- Concourse pipeline definitions were repetitive
  - Spending lot of time writing boilerplate manifests to create pipelines
- We had forked Concourse, so we had to merge changes

---

# Third Iteration

- Wrote a generation tool for Concourse Pipelines (Travel Agent)
- Moved to latest open source version of Concourse
- Fully integrated Pivotal Network resource for software dependencies 

---


# Benefits

- Reduced pipeline definitions from 400 line YAML to a template + config file 
- Built in validation of generated pipelines
- Reduced human error by reducing repetition in pipeline definitions
- We no longer have to maintain a fork of Concourse
- We no longer maintain Bash scripts to pull from Pivotal Network
- Engineering time for a new deployment went from 3 hours to under 2 hours

--- 

# What we Manage

- 6 Engineers
- 2 Datacenters
- 10 Foundations
- 11 Products
- 15 Pipelines
- 150 Automated consistent deployments

# Lessons Learned

- Iteration and learning is key and part of the journey
- Start with triggers turned off
- Don't be afraid to code 
- Focus on removing error from the system
- Smaller pipelines with a single responsibility reduce complexity
  - Faster feedback
  - Easier to reason about

---

## Don't be afraid of change, embrace it and get good at it 

---

# How to get started

- [Awesome Stark and Wayne Tutorial] (https://github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-tutorial)
- Start with Ops Manager
- Evolve to BOSH Director
- Evolve to Cloud Foundry
- Evolve to the platform

# Announcing Deployadactly
### An open source for deploying to multiple CF foundations

Deployadactyl is a Go library for deploying applications to multiple Cloud Foundry instances. Deployadactyl utilizes blue green deployments and if it's unable to push your application it will rollback to the previous version. Deployadactyl utilizes Gochannels for concurrent deployments across the multiple Cloud Foundry instances.
