#  Why Pair?

## **Why Pair?**

- Reduces ramp up time
- Helps avoid specialized knowledge
- Real time code reviews
- Keeps devs engaged and focused 
- Enables devs to spend time on most interesting parts of the code
- Fosters learning

## **Why TDD?**

- Tests tell us we have met requirements
- Tests help prevent regression
- Tests enable large refactoring without fear
- Tests force us to consume our own code, resulting in cleaner design

## **The Three Rules of TDD**[^1]

- You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## **Types of Tests**

- Acceptance Tests - End to End test of business requirement.
    - Long running
    - Brittle
    - Assertions on test fixtures
    - Golden Threads - the absolute minimum functionality that must be implemented before the system can perform its basic function.

---

## **Types of Tests**

- Integration Tests - Testing of boundaries between systems.
    - Often stub the data layer
    - Assertions on part of a response
    - Flaw is they stay green if external systems change.

---

## **Types of Tests**

- Unit/Build Tests - Individual functions and source code.
    - Very Fast
    - Should express intent of class usage
    - Like the code examples section of documentation
    - Majority of test code goes here
    - Completely decoupled from other tests
